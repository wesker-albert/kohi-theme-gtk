# kohi-theme-gtk

A dark roasted theme for GTK+ 2/3

Intended to be used alongside a tiling windows manager, without window titlebars. Thus, some decorations may be missing.

## Installation

Clone the repo, then move the `Kohi` directory to your themes folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesker-albert/kohi-theme-gtk.git /tmp/kohi-theme-gtk && \
mv /tmp/kohi-theme-gtk/Kohi ~/.themes/
```
